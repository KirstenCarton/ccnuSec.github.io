        <section>
          At <span class="ota-red">OpenToAll</span>, we try to do as many CTFs
          as possible on <a href="https://ctftime.org" target="_blank">CTFTime</a>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <a href="https://ctftime.org" target="_blank">CTFTime</a> is essentially
          a large list of scheduled CTF events throughout the year.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>If you want to know when the next CTF is, visit that website!</b>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 7 -->
        <section>
          When comes the time to participate in a CTF, we use a <code>Slack</code>
          bot called <code>@bishop</code>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This bot coordinates the whole team. It manages the list of CTFs we play
          in, the list of challenges we're working on as well as the list of active
          members working on a specific challenge...
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 8 -->
        <section>
          <code>@bishop</code> commands are simple to use. Below are
          example commands we use to create and participate in solving the
          <code>Floppy</code> challenge from <code>Google CTF 2018</code>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="ota-green">!addctf google-18</span> to
              create a new <code>#google-18</code> channel.</li>
            <li><span class="ota-green">!addchallenge floppy</span> to keep track
              of a the <code>Floppy</code> challenge.</li>
            <li><span class="ota-green">!workon floppy</span> to notify members
              that you are working on the <code>Floppy</code> challenge...</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 9 -->
        <section>
         <code>@bishop</code> will seem intimidating at first.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         You can use <span class="ota-green">!help</span> to get a list of commands
         to help you out.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Otherwise, just watch how the other members do it, and you'll get used to
         it!

        <section>
          Lastly, <span class="ota-red">OpenToAll</span> tries to encourage
          learning as much as possible.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          For this reason, we've created
          <a href="https://university.opentoallctf.com/" target="_blank">
            OTA University</a>, a wargame made exclusively for
          <span class="ota-red">OpenToAll</span> members...
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 11 -->
        <section>
          Once you get invited to <span class="ota-red">OpenToAll</span>'s
          <code>Slack</code>. Join the channel <code>#ota-university</code>
          for more information.

          Other than
          <a href="https://university.opentoallctf.com/" target="_blank">
            OTA University</a>, many members play on online wargames to
          improve their skills.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Here are a few that we use...
